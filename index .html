            <h1>My favorite hobby is coding</h1>
            <p>I like coding because during the covid 19 there is nothing to do except make an app and that interests me. So this is how I ended up make 3 apps a day. My favorite app to design are apps that help my parents understand coding as well!</p>

            <h1>My Work</h1>
            <p> I love to code because it is usable art. Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling. I love to code because it is fun to code. Coding apps let me test my abilities of coding and if I am a strong coder or if I am a weak coder. I also love to ode because it is a great actvity to do in my spare time. I am normally bored after I am done with my virtual school so if I am coding, it keeps me busy and makes coding fun for my life. When I grow up, my dream is to be an advanced coder and make apps for people who need them. My self assigned task is now to make apps for my family and friends.This is my work. This is a work made by me but I will show you 4 of my recent creations!</p>
